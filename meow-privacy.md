## We respect your privacy
#### Any data we collect is encrypted and has multiple security measures attached. If you no longer want to use the bot and feel uncomfortable with your data being stored with us, you can request a data removal. We respect your privacy and would never sell your data or infringe on your privacy rights.

#

## What Data We Collect 
#### When you first use Meow, you get a welcome message saying that Meow setup your profile. When this happens, your **UserID** and **ServerID** is stored. We use this data to get database info. **This data is encrypted and is never sold or shared.** We store **no other data**. If you want this data no longer stored, you can request a data removal. 

#

## External Websites 
#### When using Meow, you may be directed to an external website like Top.gg. We do not run these sites and don't control the data they collect about you. You can view the [Top.gg Privacy Policy](https://top.gg/privacy)

#

## Limitation in data storage 
#### We only store data that the Discord API can provide us. This means very sensitive details like your address can't and will never be stored by us. 

#

## Opt-out 
#### If you want to opt out, you do so the moment you stop using the bot. Your data is only in use when you actually use the bot. 

#

## How do I request a data removal 
#### To request a data removal join the support server @ https://discord.gg/uNTefVFPBn and ask there or DM Soldier#1111. Once your data is removed, it's no longer stored anywhere and deleted fully.
